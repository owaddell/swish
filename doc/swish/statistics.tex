\chapter {System Statistics}\label{chap:stats}

\section {Introduction}

The system uses a single gen-server named \code{statistics} to
periodically query statistics about the system, such as memory usage.

\section {Theory of Operation}

When the \code{statistics} gen-server starts, it posts a
\code{<statistics>} event with \code{reason} = \code{startup}.
Every five minutes thereafter, it posts a \code{<statistics>} event
with \code{reason} = \code{update}. If the computer sleeps or
hibernates, the gen-server posts a \code{<statistics>} event with
\code{reason} = \code{suspend}. When the computer awakens, the
gen-server posts a \code{<statistics>} event with \code{reason} =
\code{resume}. When the gen-server terminates, it posts a
\code{<statistics>} event with \code{reason} = \code{shutdown}.

The \code{<statistics>} event is handled by the \code{log-db}
gen-server (see Chapter~\ref{chap:log-db}), which adds the data to the
statistics table in the log database.

\section {Programming Interface}

\defineentry{statistics:start\&link}
\begin{procedure}
  \code{(statistics:start\&link)}
\end{procedure}
\returns{}
\code{\#(ok \var{pid})} $|$
\code{\#(error \var{error})}

The \code{statistics:start\&link} procedure creates a new gen-server
named \code{statistics} using \code{gen-server:start\&link}. It
then posts a \code{<statistics>} event with \code{reason} =
\code{startup}.

\defineentry{statistics:resume}
\begin{procedure}
  \code{(statistics:resume)}
\end{procedure}

The \code{statistics:resume} procedure casts a message to the
\code{statistics} gen-server that causes it to publish a
\code{<statistics>} event with \code{reason} = \code{resume}. This
procedure is called from the operating system interface via the
top-level-value \code{\$resume}.

\defineentry{statistics:suspend}
\begin{procedure}
  \code{(statistics:suspend)}
\end{procedure}

The \code{statistics:suspend} procedure casts a message to the
\code{statistics} gen-server that causes it to publish a
\code{<statistics>} event with \code{reason} = \code{suspend}.  This
procedure is called from the operating system interface via the
top-level-value \code{\$suspend}.

\section {Published Events}

\begin{pubevent}{<statistics>}
  \argrow{timestamp}{timestamp from \code{erlang:now}}
  \argrow{date}{date from \code{current-date}}
  \argrow{reason}{\code{startup}, \code{update}, \code{suspend},
    \code{resume}, or \code{shutdown}}
  \argrow{bytes-allocated}{Scheme heap size from \code{bytes-allocated}}
  \argrow{current-memory-bytes}{Scheme heap size including overhead,
    from \code{current-memory-bytes}}
  \argrow{maximum-memory-bytes}{maximum Scheme heap size including overhead,
    since startup or since the last \code{<statistics>} event,
    from \code{maximum-memory-bytes}}
  \argrow{osi-bytes-used}{C heap size from \code{osi\_get\_bytes\_used}}
  \argrow{sqlite-memory}{SQLite memory used from
    \code{osi\_get\_sqlite\_status}}
  \argrow{sqlite-memory-highwater}{SQLite memory highwater since
    last event from \code{osi\_get\_sqlite\_status}}
  \argrow{foreign-handles}{JSON object with types and counts reported by \code{count-foreign-handles}}
  \argrow{cpu}{CPU time in seconds since last event}
  \argrow{real}{elapsed time in seconds since last event}
  \argrow{bytes}{Scheme heap bytes allocated since last event}
  \argrow{gc-count}{number of garbage collections since last event}
  \argrow{gc-cpu}{CPU time in seconds of garbage collections since
    last event}
  \argrow{gc-real}{elapsed time in seconds of garbage collections
    since last event}
  \argrow{gc-bytes}{Scheme heap bytes reclaimed since last event}
  \argrow{os-free-memory}{current free memory from \code{osi\_get\_free\_memory}}
\end{pubevent}

Each time a \code{<statistics>} event is emitted,
the maximum memory bytes value is reset via \code{reset-maximum-memory-bytes!}.

The JSON object in the \code{foreign-handles} field contains at least the following entries:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
 \code{bindings} & {number of live marshaled SQLite bindings} \\
 \code{databases} & {number of open SQLite databases} \\
 \code{osi-ports} & {number of open osi-ports} \\
 \code{path-watchers} & {number of open path watchers} \\
 \code{statements} & {number of unfinalized SQLite statements} \\
 \code{tcp-listeners} & {number of open TCP/IP listeners} \\
\end{tabular}

This event is sent every five minutes while the \code{statistics}
gen-server is running.
